#### Summary of the variables in the dataset

0 = no diabetes 1 = prediabetes 2 = diabetes

## Data exploration and data wrangling

Initially, the database “diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv” provided by the teacher is loaded, for this the following function was used:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
data <- read.delim("clipboard")
data
```

Where: 

"data" loads specified data sets or lists available data sets.

"read.delim" = Reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to lines and variables to fields in the file.

I used "clipboard" to paste the data from diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv since I had it in an excel file and I clicked run on the code to save it.

```{r cars1, include=FALSE}
data 
str(data)
```

"Data" We use it to review the data in general, where it tells us that we have 22 variables and 253680 observations.



## Variables present in the database

"Str" is used to view each of the variables contained in the database.

```{r cars2, include=FALSE}
data 
str(data)
```

![Variables](datos.png)

## First Observations

With the "head" function it shows me the first observations of the ENTIRE database.

```{r cars3, include=FALSE}
data 
str
str(data)
head(data)
```


![Variables](head.png)


## Ultimas Observaciones

With the "tail" function it shows me the latest observations of the ENTIRE database.

```{r cars4, include=FALSE}
data 
str(data)
head(data)
tail(data)
```

![Variables](tail.png)

## General Summary

With the "summary" function it shows me a summary of the ENTIRE database, discriminating for each variable, the mean, median, minimum, maximum and others.

```{r cars5, include=FALSE}
data 
str(data)
head(data)
tail(data)
summary(data)
```


![Variables](Summary.png)
##### To see the summary of each variable you must use the "attach" function

```{r cars6, include=FALSE}
attach(data)
```

Now it is possible to request the summary or the mean, or median among others for each variable

```{r cars7, include=FALSE}
summary(data$BMI)

#If I want to see the mean of some variable, I use mean and in this case "Smoker"
mean(data$Smoker)
```

![Variables](RESUMENBMI.png)
![Variables](MEDIASMOKER.png)


##### We can request the variance per variable and/or the standard deviation

```{r cars8, include=FALSE}
var (data)

sd(data$Diabetes_012)
```


![Variables](HISTOGRAMA DIABETES AZUL.png)

## Database Sampling

I will start using the following function, which allows me to choose a specific sample. If I don't have it, every time I compile the code it will show me a different sample.

```{r cars11, include=FALSE}
set.seed(15000)
```

#### We will call a new variable for the random sample and select the number of observations to show, I chose 500

```{r cars12, include=FALSE}
muestra_aleatoria <- sample(253680,500, replace = FALSE);muestra_aleatoria
```

![Variables](Reduccion de database.png)
![Variables](Muestra aleatoria500.png)


#### We select the sort function to organize our sample and call a new variable

```{r cars13, include=FALSE}
orden_muestra <- sort(muestra_aleatoria);orden_muestra
```


#### To view it in a table we select a name for the sample, call the main database, and write "view"

```{r cars14, include=FALSE}
muestra <- data[orden_muestra,]; View(muestra)
```

#### Now we can do the same as we did before, but with the sample, select a summary, the mean of a variable, the median, the maximum, minimum or others.

```{r cars15, include=FALSE}
summary(muestra)
```

#### I can show the general data of the sample

```{r cars16, include=FALSE}
str(muestra)
```

#### I can make a sample table
  
```{r cars17, include=FALSE}
table(muestra)
tab <- table(muestra)
```

#### I will show a sample bar graph

![Variables](grafico de barras .png)

#### You can also show a pie chart but it is more useful in categorical variables, in this case select only 50 observations so that it looks better

## Graph correlation, the closest to diabetes is the body mass index "BMI"

![Variables](correlacion diabetes y indice.png)

### To check how many people have diabetes, prediabetes or do not have in numerical values

![Variables](diabetes numerico.png)

#### We call a new variable new to change the variable from numeric to categorical. The function "as.factor" is used to encode a vector as a factor (the terms "category" and "enumerated type" are also used for factors).


#### Taking into account what was provided by the teacher, it is taken into account that patients without diabetes are represented as 0, prediabetes 1 and diabetes 2

![Variables](bina.png)

### With the levels function, it links 0, 1 and 2 of the variable Diabetes_012 and then with labels I place the names that I will change, in this case, no diabetes, prediabetes and diabetes.

"Str" again to see if the change was made to these categorical variables

#Create a table that shows me how many patients have diabetes, how many do not, and how many have prediabetes.
